Testing
Testing is the method through which we try to find errors in our software.

Types of Testing
Unit Testing
It is done for the smallest unit of the program. We can perform this by using sample input and see if it produces the desired output.

Integration Testing
It is done to test the integrity of group of units - to checker whether they perform the desired function.

It is of four types:

-Top down

-Bottom up

-Sandwich

-Big-Bang

Example :

Black Box testing:- It is used for validation. Here we only check the output.

White Box testing:- It is used for verification. Here, we also see the internal processes.

Regression Testing
This testing is done to ensure that the programs works properly after the addition of new components.

Smoke Testing
It is done to see the stability of the software for subsequent testing. It is named so as testing initial pass is done to check if it did not smoke (or catch fire) in the initial switch on.

Alpha Testing
It is done before handing over the product to customers. It is a type of validation testing.

Beta Testing
The product is released to few end-users and they test it in real-time environment.

System Testing
It is done to ensure that the software work properly in different OS. It is part of black box testing. It includes security testing, recovery testing , stress testing and performance testing.

Stress Testing
We test the software in suboptimal conditions to see how it stands.

Performance Testing
It generally tests the speed of the program. It is also known as load testing. We check the run-time performance of the software.
